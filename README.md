# CodeAcademyDoors
Code Academy Doors HTML/CSS/JS exercise.

## The game
You are presented with three doors. Two of them lead to a lush beach and the depths of cosmos, but the other one houses a robot, who is here to enslave humanity and make you do chores.

Pick the door with the bot last to win the game!

## How it works
This is an excercise in connecting HTML, CSS and JS to make a functioning web page. We assign the variables to DOM elements and use functions to change, manipulate and mutate them.

## Future improvements:

1. The CSS and layout
    The excercise required the use of a table instead of a numbered list, for some reason. Will change that.
2. The functionality:

    2.1 Win - Lose streak

    2.2 Difficulty - Easy/Normal/Hard/Custom
        The custom difficulty will require the use of objects and arrays.
    
    2.3 True randomness
        Currently there are three configurations of images with predetermined outcomes. By learning where a certain image ends up in every configuration, it's quite simple to cheat the game. Besides, adding true randomness is essential to the custom mode.
